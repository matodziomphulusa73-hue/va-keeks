                    To my dearest Keneilwe,

As I sit here today, I’m not just thinking about Valentine’s Day and all the traditions that come with it. I’m thinking about the last six months , 26 weeks ,184 days , 4416 hours , 264 960 minutes and 15 897 600 seconds since August 14th 2025,and how much my life has changed since the moment you walked into it. They say time flies when you’re having fun, but with you, time feels different. It feels significant.

I wanted to take this moment to tell you how incredibly proud I am of you. Watching you navigate your world, seeing the way you handle your challenges with grace, and witnessing your growth has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. You have this quiet strength and a heart pure and so genuine that it's impossible not to be inspired by you. Whether you see it or not, you are doing amazing things, and I am consistently in awe of the woman you are.

Six months might seem like a short time to some, but to me, it’s the foundation of everything I want for the future . It symbolizes the effort, the love , the difficulties the tears, being able to forgive each other, the weeks , days , hours , minutes and seconds we've had to wake up and choose each other to reach this milestone.There's so much i've learnt from being with you and from you.  You’ve become my safest place, my favorite laugh, and my first thought every single morning. You’ve taught me what it means to be truly supported and loved unconditionally and what it feels like to have a best friend and a partner all wrapped into one.

Thank you for choosing me every day for the last half-year. Thank you for the cute dates, the long talks, the sunset strolls, the meals we made together ,even the quiet moments where we don't have to say anything at all but most importantly your presence. I don't need a holiday like today to tell you that I love you and appreciate what we have, but I’m glad it gives me an extra reason to celebrate us.
                    <br /><br />
                    Happy 6 months, and Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. I’d choose you a thousand times over, in every lifetime.I Love You So BIGGGG
